# Uniglos Chat Dynamics

## Project Overview
"Uniglos Chat Dynamics" is an analytical exploration of the group chat dynamics within the "Uniglos Fam" group, presumably associated with the University of Gloucestershire. Using Power BI, this project dissects the group's messaging patterns to understand the flow of conversation, peak activity times, and the most engaged members.

## Features
- **Daily Messaging Trends**: Insights into how the frequency of messages varies day-to-day, with highlighted peaks that may correspond to specific events.
- **Hourly Activity Analysis**: A breakdown of the most active hours within the group, pinpointing when members are most likely to engage in conversation.
- **Weekly Engagement Patterns**: A visual representation of message counts by weekdays, revealing the group's preferred days for interaction.
- **Member Engagement Metrics**: Identification of the top contributors within the group, providing an understanding of member participation.
- **Lexical Analysis**: A word cloud visualization that sheds light on the most frequently used words, hinting at the prevalent topics of discussion.

## Visualizations
- **Daily Message Sent**: A line chart tracking the count of messages sent each day over a period, showing the ebb and flow of group engagement.
- **Total Messages by Hour of the Day**: A histogram displaying the distribution of messages throughout a 24-hour period, indicating peak activity times.
- **Count of Messages by Weekdays**: A bar chart that outlines the messaging frequency across different days of the week.

## Data Insights
- Average messages, words, and letters per day provide a quantitative measure of chat activity.
- Active hours and days analysis help in determining the best times for important announcements or engagement initiatives.
- The frequency of specific words can help in understanding the common themes or concerns among the group members.
